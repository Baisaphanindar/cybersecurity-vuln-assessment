Vulnerability Assessment of OWASP Juice Shop using ZAP, Burp Suite, etc.
 Web Application Vulnerability Assessment Project

This project is part of a hands-on cybersecurity internship where I performed a vulnerability assessment of a test web application using ethical hacking tools and OWASP Top 10 standards.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Identify web app security flaws using tools like OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite
- Test for common vulnerabilities: SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, etc.
- Document findings with impact level, screenshots, and mitigation steps
- Align findings with OWASP Top 10
- Create a professional Security Assessment Report

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- 🧪 [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
- ⚒️ OWASP ZAP
- 🔍 Burp Suite Community Edition
- 🐧 Kali Linux
- 📝 Google Docs (for report writing)

## 📄 Deliverables

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Security_Assessment_Report.pdf` | Final security report with detailed findings |
| `OWASP_Top10_Checklist.pdf` | Mapping of vulnerabilities to OWASP Top 10 |
| `tool-logs/` | ZAP & Burp scan logs |
| `screenshots/` | Screenshots of attack vectors and findings |
| `payloads-used/` | Custom payloads for testing |

## ✅ Key Findings

- High-Risk: SQL Injection on login form
- Medium-Risk: Stored XSS in feedback section
- Low-Risk: Information disclosure via verbose error messages

## 📚 Learning Outcome

- Developed skills in ethical hacking, reporting, OWASP Top 10
- Gained hands-on experience with professional security tools
- Produced a report simulating real-world client work
